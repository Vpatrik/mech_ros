This repository contains ROS based software part of the project.

## Simulation - Created simulation environment in Gazebo, URDF robot model

### Working features in Gazebo:
 - Localization using fiducials
 - SLAM
 - Navigation - use of move_base_flex
 - Whole robot charging cycle - use of SMACH

## Real robot - Currently testing procedures in laboratory

### Working features in real world:
 - SLAM
 - Localization
 - Navigation
 - Following marker
